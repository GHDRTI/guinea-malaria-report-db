## Getting started

These files are used to transform data from the national HMIS to the Stop Palu database.
To run the Paludisme dataset importer you will need login credentials for both the SystÃ¨me National d'Information Sanitaire and the Stop Palu database. There are three steps to this process:

1.)  The first is to export the Paludisme dataset
2.) Transform the data set to a import file that is compatible with the Stop Palu database, by a) replacing the facility organisation units with their equivalents in the Stop Palu database and b) replacing the data elements and their disaggregations ( aka category option combonations) with their equivilants in the Stop Palu database. 
3.) Import the resulting file from step 2 into the Stop Palu database


The mapping files for step two are right here`orgUnits.xml` and `dataElements`. As with anything data entry into DHIS2, the Analytics table will need to be updated before the updated data can be viewed in the Pivot Table app.


## Run this as a windows batch file

To run this on Windows you will need to install msxsl, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21714). Once this is installed run the batch file from a windows command line.
